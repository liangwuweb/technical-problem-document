# Push notification cannot show in "Building Progressive Web Apps" by Tal Ater

## The Problem
This document is an exploration of a problem I've met when following the "Building Progressive Web Apps" by Tal Ater. The problem is I cannot make the push notification to work on the app. According to the chapter 10 in the book, it supposes to ask user for permission after user clicks the making reservation button . If user grants the permission, the website will send a notification which contain the reservation details.(Figure 1)

*Firgue 1 The behavior of the ideal push notification*

## The Reason
After investigation, I found the reason is the subscription object generated by the server when user create a reservation. These reservatons contains a public key. This key will be matched with the private key store in our server. When I granted the permission last time, the server will store my subscription in the database. My subscriptions' public key might be outdated. So it cannot match with the private key. As a result, the notification cannot be pushed to user. Below is my investigation.
